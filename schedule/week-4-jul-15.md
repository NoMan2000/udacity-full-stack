# Your Developer Toolbox

Complete all of the lessons in Developers’ Tools which includes:

* Shell Workshop

* Purpose and Terminology

* Create a Git Repo
* Review a Repo’s History
* Add Commits to a Repo
* Tagging, Branching and Merging
* Undoing Changes
* Working with Remotes
* Working on Another Developer’s Repository
* Staying in Sync with a Remote Repository
* Requests and Responses
* The Web from Python
* HTTP in the Real World

This looks like a lot, but each lesson is relatively brief. All of the material here is important to be prepared for working on more complex projects as you progress further.

We will be looking at [Learn Enough Git to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial).  We will also need to discuss tagging under the concept of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
