# Programming Foundations with Python

In the Project: _Movie Trailer Website_ part of the online syllabus, complete the following lessons in the Programming Fundamentals and the Web module:

* Introduction
* Use Functions
* Use Classes: Draw Turtles
* Use Classes: Profanity Editor
* Make Classes: Movie Website

Things I will probably be adding:

* Discussion of Github.  Probably will do a workshop so everyone is familiar with collaborating.  Run through codeschool's [Git training](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git).
* Discussion of c9.io.
* Downloading of PyCharm Community Edition \(free and awesome\)
* Discussion of Python 2 vs Python 3.
* Installation of pyenv and a discussion of how to use it.
* Discussion of unit tests \(just the intro\)
* Downloading[ Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/)

Steps:

* Download Python.
* Create a directory.
* Change to that directory.
  * run `python -m venv pyrepo`
  * run `source pyrepo/bin/activate`
  * run `pip install pyflakes pytest hypothesis mypy`
* What this does is creates a virtual environment, \(we'll discuss in class\), then activates it, then pip install adds in four modules:  pyflakes and mypy are for code linting; pytest and hypothesis are for testing code.
