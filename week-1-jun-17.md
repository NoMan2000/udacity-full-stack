# Programming Foundations with Python

In the Project: _Movie Trailer Website_ part of the online syllabus, complete the following lessons in the Programming Fundamentals and the Web module:

* Introduction
* Use Functions
* Use Classes: Draw Turtles
* Use Classes: Profanity Editor
* Make Classes: Movie Website

Things I will probably be adding:

* Downloading of PyCharm Community Edition \(free and awesome\)
* Discussion of Python 2 vs Python 3.
* Installation of pyenv and a discussion of how to use it.
* Discussion of unit tests \(just the intro\)
