# Welcome to Udacity's Full Stack Developer Class!  \(June 2017\)

This will introduce you to various aspects of programming that you will need to know to be a web developer.  There are a few things that will be introduced.  The first is that PHP will be used as an alternative language to introduce you to more traditional programming concepts.  Python is a great language, but it handles certain things differently than most languages, \(Java, C++, etc.\).  

The second is that there will be a focus on unit tests and testing principles in general.  Tests are ways of verifying that code works the way that you expect.  There are numerous benefits to a good testing strategy. 

1. Prevents bugs from appearing during a release.  \(Known as regression bugs.\)
2. Creates a form of documentation that developers can read easily.  In fact, the test code should be written as well, if not better, than the source code.
3. Requires a developer to understand how to write _clean code_.  The easier code is to test, the cleaner it is.  Code that is difficult to test is known as a _code smell_, a sign that the code needs to be improved.
4. Gives confidence during _refactoring_.  Refactoring is the process of improving code quality while not changing functionality.
